This is an example that came out of the virtual lessons
for week 7.  It is a website that uses sinatra and demonstrates
HTTP requests and query parameters.  It is a skeleton of what
you would need to add a web front end to your code

## What does this do?
This is a web frontend that allows a user to select
how many random numbers they want and have it printed on screen

How to Use
==========
1. Clone this repository
2. cd into directory
3. run '$ bundle install'
4. run '$ rerun "ruby app.rb" '
   NOTE: rerun is a program that watches for changes in your code
         and auto updates the website
5. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:4567/
